# RTXForge

**GeForce tools, built for Linux.** A native GTK4/libadwaita library manager for Bazzite GNOME, distributed as an AppImage. No Windows client is planned for this release.

## Install and update

Download the Bazzite x86_64 AppImage from [Releases](https://github.com/lrnolivia/RTXForge/releases), mark it executable and open it. Choose **Install / update app** in Settings to register it in your launcher. Alternatively:

```sh
chmod +x RTXForge-0.5.4-Bazzite-x86_64.AppImage
./RTXForge-0.5.4-Bazzite-x86_64.AppImage --install
```

The persistent copy lives in `~/.local/share/rtxforge/application/RTXForge.AppImage`. Repeat with a newer download to update; the previous AppImage is retained. Updating the application does not redeploy games.

## Providers and installation

Settings offers **y4my Multipass** and **DLSS-Unlocked**, with complete, separately pinned packages. See [providers/lock.json](providers/lock.json) for exact commits, release URLs and SHA-256 values. Packages are downloaded and verified when preparing an action. Arbitrary repositories and independent provider updates are future work.

Choose **MFG Only** or **NR + MFG**, select games, and review the floating action panel. Close Steam before applying so its launch settings can be saved safely. Uninstall the current provider before changing providers. Original terminal-edition baselines are reused; older desktop installations retain the legacy Undo path.

**Enable effects at startup** is off by default while the reported launch failures await game validation. Enable it to activate Ada MFG and, for NR + MFG, NR on installation. NR is activated before launch rather than relying on an in-game toggle. y4my needs a suitable local NR DLL (Settings, an existing game copy, or a locally discovered model); DLSS-Unlocked supplies its own NR package. MFG Only omits NR DLLs; stock upstream builds may still show their NR menu.

The engine leaves game-native DLSS-G in control: OptiScaler replacement input/output are `nofg`, with Ada unlock controlled separately. This corrects RC1.38's supposedly dormant `dlssg` output, which could initialize private Streamline at device creation even with FrameGen disabled. It is a source-level correction, not proof that every reported game crash is resolved.

## Library and reports

Poster, capsule and list views, artwork-led game details, provider buttons, selection and library actions remain available. Each game has notes and **Untested / Working / Problem / Bench** status. Bench excludes a game from bulk install/repair. Start and finish test records manually; the app records installed proxy hashes and copies bounded adjacent diagnostic logs. Support ZIPs stay local until you share them. A test record is not automatic evidence of runtime success.

## Terminal and development

From source, run `./rtxforge` or `./START\ HERE.sh`. In the AppImage, use `--cli`. Both use the RC1.38-derived engine in `engine/rtxengine.py` through the same provider adapter as the GUI.

```sh
./RTXForge-0.5.4-Bazzite-x86_64.AppImage --cli --help
```

Provider flags: `--runtime-provider y4my|dlss-unlocked`, `--feature-mode mfg-only|nr-mfg`, `--enable-effects`.

Read [WORKER_CONTEXT.md](WORKER_CONTEXT.md) and [NOTES.md](NOTES.md) before development. [Release notes](docs/RELEASE-0.5.4.md) describe validation and outstanding work. Historical custom MFG builds and their tags are preserved, but are not bundled into this release.

DLSS-Unlocked offers separate **NR Only** (pinned NR-v0.8.6; keep in-game FG off) and **MFG Only** (NR-v0.9.1, NR off, bundled NVIDIA runtime updates) pipelines. MFG Only backs up existing native DLLs and restores them on uninstall. Uninstall before changing pipelines. Combined NR + MFG remains available for experimentation.

Selected effects are enabled automatically when installed or repaired. Choose DLSS and the FG multiplier in the game settings; opening the OptiScaler overlay is unnecessary. CLI diagnosis may use `--disable-effects`.
